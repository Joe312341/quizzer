# Quizzer
Sample Quiz App using React Native, Redux and Realm.js

This was the first React Native app I built after having used React and Redux in the past.

# Summary
The app lets users configure the difficulty and amount of questions they want to be asked before they start playing. 
The quiz portion itself works similar to the popular QuizUp (https://www.quizup.com) mobile app, but it is single player only.
Results are stored using Realm.js

# API

Api calls are made and dealt with using Redux-Saga

This app uses the Open Trivia DB, which can be found here: https://opentdb.com
